            <p>
              My name is Tanner Turgeon and I am a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying Computer Science. I started college
              in August of 2019 with no idea of what career I wanted to pursue. I was working two jobs at that time, one as an Evening Captain
              at the Legacy Estates Retirement Community and the other as a Student Worker at Love Library. With very little expectataions I began
              taking a multidude of exploratory courses like Astronomy, Nutrional Science, and Physics. As an undeclared major, I knew that
              by the time I hit my 3rd year in college it was required that I declare a major. My final semester as a Sophmore I had decided to take my
              first Computer Science course and that was that. I ended up loving the idea of being able to create programs and solve problems, and while
              debugging can be somewhat of a chore (especially after realizing it was just a missing semicolon) I was always met with a great feeling of
              accomplishment when finishing a project.

              At the moment I only have an Intro to Packet Tracer Certification but I am working on a Full-Stack Engineer Certification with Codecademy
              as well as a Certificate of Completion on Powershell with Codecademy.

              is designed to show various projects and things I have been working on to prove I know what I am talking about.
